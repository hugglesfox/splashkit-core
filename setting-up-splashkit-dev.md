## Building SplashKit

Requires
- Base-level reqs
  - clang Compiler
  - git
- OS-specific reqs
  - mac
    - XCode
  - Windows
    - MSYS2

If you are reading this then you have probably already found the Splashkit-core Git repo, at least via the web client interface.  To Follow these instructions you will need to [fork and clone](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the Splashkit core SDK.

##  Steps for setting up
### Mac

1. Install brew.
  -  In Terminal run this command:   ```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"  ```.
  -  Use brew to install basic tools.
  -  Write into terminal window:   ```brew install git svn mercurial  ```.
  -  (optional) brew cask install atom.
2.  Install XCode.
  -  Install Command Line Tools by writing this into the terminal:   ```xcode-select --install  ```.
3.  Clone repository
  -  In Terminal, make a working directory (can also be on cloud) and then move into the directory using:   ```cd <YourProjFolder>  ```.
  -  from in the directory run the git clone command   ```git clone <url>  ```
4.  setup
  -  using `cd` go to the directory location:   ```splashkit/coresdk/external  ```
  -  Run setup.sh with    ```./setup.sh  ```
  -  Go to the   ```coresdk/project  ``` folder and open in XCode.
  -  Build and Run from in XCode.  

### Windows
* If an issue, potentially consider **temporarily** disabling antivirus software.
* Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) subsystem and follow fairly self-explanatory installer instructions &ndash; use defaults if unsure, **DO NOT INSTALL TO DIRECTORY WITH SPACES!**
* Install core Splashkit SDK
    - Go into MSYS2 terminal emulator and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) over MSYS2 subsystem by typing :
      ```
    pacman -S git --noconfirm --disable-download-timeout
      ```
    - Now clone and install Splashkit via install-scripts:
      ```
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
      ```
    - Restart terminal, type
      ```
    skm
      ```
    in terminal after restarting to verify successful install.
* Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Install language tools (compilers / libs):
    - For C#, install the DotNet core sdk.
    - For C++, install GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) - g++ and clang++ in MSYS2.
      - Run the following command in terminal:
        ```
      pacman --disable-download-timeout -S mingw-w64-{x86_64,i686}-gcc mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-gdb
        ```
      - Do not run compiler from main MSYS2 MSYS terminal, instead run from MSYS2 MinGW32 or MinGW64 terminals.
* Install  remaining tools to build Splashkit:
    - Install cmake:
      ```
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
      ```
    - install make:
      ```
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
      ```
* Build the test project:
    - Go into the cloned directory of your Splashkit fork, open a MinGw-W64 MSYS2 shell and type:
      ```
    cd projects/cmake
     ```
      ```
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
      ```
      ```
    make
      ```
    - Note: if the above does not work, try using the actual unix make and cmake installations, rather than the MinGw-specific ones; but do not try a combination of both. Remove packages with
      ```
    pacman -Rs <package>
      ```
    and
      ```
    pacman -S cmake make
      ```
* Run the test program by executing
    ```
    cd ../../bin
    ```
    ```
    ./sktest
      ```
* Add features to code in
    ```
    ./coresdk
    ```
* Add test code into
    ```
    coresdk/src/test
    ```
Now you should be good to go.
